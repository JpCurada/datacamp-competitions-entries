Background\n\nManufacturing high-precision metal components requires consistent machine performance. A major manufacturer in aerospace, automotive, and medical device sectors operates three machines for different component sizes. Current maintenance relies on reactive approaches, leading to production delays and increased costs. The company collected operational data for over a year to shift towards predictive maintenance.","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"69c7cade-ac2b-4e6c-8ab7-45b1e7ff21d8"},{"source":"## II. Objectives\nThe analysis aims to:\n1. Identify correlations between operational variables in the manufacturing process\n2. Detect temporal patterns in machine downtime\n3. Determine key factors linked to machine failures\n4. Create a foundation for developing predictive maintenance models","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"f3d10a3b-d8fc-4ccb-ba78-a257f1a7db5c"},{"source":"## III. About the Dataset\n\nThe dataset contains daily operational readings from three manufacturing machines over a one-year period. It tracks 13 mechanical measurements including pressure, temperature, vibration, and electrical readings. Each record includes the date, machine ID, assembly line number, and downtime status. This comprehensive data enables both broad operational analysis and specific investigation of conditions leading to machine failures.\n\n| Column Name | Description | Unit | Significance

Data Quality Checks\n\nWe start with data quality checks because sensor data often contains errors that could mislead our predictions. Missing values might indicate sensor malfunctions, while outliers could represent either actual machine issues or measurement errors. Understanding these issues helps us decide whether to clean, impute, or remove problematic data before modeling. Poor quality data leads to unreliable predictions.","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"32a0df8a-38c0-48c7-9c51-9aa25ef78d2f"},{"source":"# Follow the convention for naming columns by converting it to snake-case\ndata = clean_column_names(data)\ndata.columns","metadata":{"executionCancelledAt":null,"executionTime":54,"lastExecutedAt":1736081036081,"lastExecutedByKernel":"e3d9c1da-05c4-410a-b514-83843c8732d0","lastScheduledRunId":null,"lastSuccessfullyExecutedCode":"# Follow the convention for naming columns by converting it to snake-case\ndata = clean_column_names(data)\ndata.columns","outputsMetadata":{"0":{"height":500,"type":"dataFrame","tableState":{"quickFilterText":""}}}},"cell_type":"code","id":"0c9c1c77-561a-4e9a-849b-d662fd765cdd","outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":"Index(['date', 'machine_id', 'assembly_line_no', 'hydraulic_pressure_bar',\n       'coolant_pressure_bar', 'air_system_pressure_bar',\n       'coolant_temperature', 'hydraulic_oil_temperature',\n       'spindle_bearing_temperature', 'spindle_vibration', 'tool_vibration',\n       'spindle_speed_rpm', 'voltage_volts', 'torque_nm', 'cutting_kn',\n       'downtime'],\n      dtype='object')"},"metadata":{},"execution_count":128}],"execution_count":128},{"source":"#### 1.a.
