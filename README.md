## DataCamp Competition Workspaces

This repository contains my workspaces and notebooks used for various DataCamp competitions. Each folder represents a separate competition entry.

**Overview:**

* I have included notebooks for data exploration, cleaning, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation. 
* Feel free to explore the notebooks and code to learn about my approach to each competition.
* Links to the competition pages are provided for further details. 

**Contents:**

**1. Understanding Fossil Records and Cinema Films (Everyone Can Learn Data Scholarship)**

* **Description:** This competition involved analyzing fossil records and cinema films to understand the relationship between extinction events and film releases. (3rd Place Winner)

**3. How do machines behave before downtime? (Predicting industrial machine downtime  Level 2)**

* **Description:** Building on Level 1, this competition focused on identifying patterns in sensor data that precede machine failures. (Level 2)

**Additional Notes:**

* The notebooks may require specific libraries and dependencies. Please check the code for details.
* While I strive to provide clear and well-documented notebooks, some sections might require additional context or explanation.

Feel free to reach out with any questions or comments on my approach to these competitions!
